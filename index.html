It was made to function as a surface for display. A disturbing piece that can adapt anywhere due to its thin latex skin. Its rubber touch prevents objects from falling and with the help of the nipples and the shapes in it, anything can adapt. Also seen as camouflage, or an intervention furniture, ready to action! You can throw it anywhere and the nipples will fly and stick like crazy. The Skin Furniture is ready for any kind 
of actions. Disturbing to see but pleasing to touch. And right here <a href="lagoon.html"> <img src="file:///Users/clarapasteau/Documents/4.%20BSSA/2.%20folders%20per%20week/1.%20Week/5%20day/html_project_my_webpage/Links/IMG-1602.JPG" class="lagoon"> </a> is a swimming pool i've built, or as it is called "the lagoon for waterproof books".
